# Web-scraping
Purpose: Extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Scrape various types of information including HTML tables and recurring elements.  Two deliverables: Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles, Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table

This activity did the webscraping from an html page.  I utilized a lot of the notes from the class to build the code to retrieve the data needed.  Reviewed code to use the groupby feature to find the lowest and highest values for temperature and pressure.  Then exported the data to a csv file. 

Resources: I utilized askBCS to figure out an issue with displaying the data at various times. I needed to select a different class than I originally had (which found everything). Researched a lot of sites to help with changing the datatypes but I found this site: "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/change-data-type-for-one-or-more-columns-in-pandas-dataframe/" which was very helpful in converting multiple datatypes.
