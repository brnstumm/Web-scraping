# Web-scraping
This activity did the webscraping from an html page.  I used a lot of the notes from the class to build the code to retrieve the data needed for the assignment.  I also looked at previous lessons to export the data to a csv file and to do the groupby code to find the lowest and highest values for temperature and pressure.
I utilized askBCS to figure out a issue with displaying the data multiple times.  It turned out that the variable I created did not limit the information enough, so I added "('div', class_='list_text')" in place of the open list of finding anything.  
Researched a lot of sites to help with changing the datatypes but I found this site: "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/change-data-type-for-one-or-more-columns-in-pandas-dataframe/" which was very helpful in converting multiple datatypes.
